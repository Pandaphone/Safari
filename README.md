# Safari

This game is my submission for my first Milestone project! A city has been devastated by an invasion of mutant bugs! Now it's up to you to get yourself out or die...

# How to Play

Just click anywhere within the canvas on the screen to make the car jump over the enemies moving toward it. Watch out though! Click too early and you might just jump right into an enemy's trap!

The game is designed with one player in mind, but I'm sure two or more would take turns until they die.

# Inspiration

Started in my mind as a game about the african savannah, something more wild. Gradually became a city as I worked through the project code.

# Technologies Used

Didn't get complex with the technologies. Just used HTML, CSS, Javascript.

# Bugs

Buttons to reset sometimes don't work first click. Car animation will act strange and lag if the screen is clicked too much.

# Unfinished Functionality

In the future, I'd like to implement a counter that increases the game's difficulty based on how long you last.
Making the jump tied to the length of the click as well as making keyboard controls optional.
Allowing the player to move across the screen horizontally as well as implementing levels where it's space-based and plays like Xevious or Galaga.
